Dona is a data donation platform for messaging data from WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. The donation process goes as follows:
1. The participants request their messaging data from WhatsApp, Facebook or Instagram as downloadable files.
2. On the Dona webpage, these files are uploaded to be de-identified: only
anonymized IDs, timestamps and message lengths are stored. No message content ever leaves the device of the participants!
3. Participants receive visual feedback on their messaging behavior to get insights into their own data as a reward.
Please watch the video below for a demo walkthrough. To try it out yourself please visit <a href="/dona-blog/more/">https://mbp-lab.github.io/dona-blog/more/</a>
